# ISO 3166
Is a library for simple access to the ISO-3166 country codes.
With enumeration values to simplify mapping from local standards to ISO-3166.

The data in the library is taken from the specification:
   https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes
   
But the generator could be extended to read the XML from https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html as well.
